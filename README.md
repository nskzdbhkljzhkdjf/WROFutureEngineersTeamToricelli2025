This Arduino-based code controls an autonomous car using ultrasonic sensors and servos to navigate and avoid obstacles. It determines the optimal turning direction at corners, measures distances for wall-following, and corrects its trajectory. The car performs iterative movements, measurements, and adjustments until a set path is completed.
