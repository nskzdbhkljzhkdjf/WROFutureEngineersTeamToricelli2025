This Arduino-based code controls an autonomous car using ultrasonic sensors and servos to navigate and avoid obstacles. It determines the optimal turning direction at corners, measures distances for wall-following, and corrects its trajectory. The car performs iterative movements, measurements, and adjustments until a set path is completed.

## Introduction
***
_This program is designed to control an autonomous vehicle using an Arduino microcontroller. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure distances, a servo motor to adjust sensor direction, and DC motors for movement. The vehicle navigates through a predefined path, detects corners, decides the optimal turning direction, and corrects its alignment based on distance measurements to maintain a consistent path along walls or corridors._
